Fundamental shifts in the market have led to organizations operating within volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA). This has resulted in fewer markets with unknown opportunities for profit, and places to hide during market turbulence. 

Business, both large and small, will need to shift their thinking on what work, strategy, and creativity are. The majority of processes currently deployed at organizations are superficial and lead to a marginal, if any, the competitive advantage, or built on assumptions that are no longer relevant or accurate. 

At Walmart, I focus on the cross section of data science and advanced technologies to optimize financial markets, corporate strategy, and business process for the VUCA age. By analyzing market trends and strategic frameworks with bleeding edge algorithms and machine, I've come to the conclusion that competitive advantage lay in the embrace of complexity, faster information to action times, and the unorthodox. And being agnostic to how an entity makes money or reacts to markets - especially true of asset-rich businesses such as Walmart. This site is meant to house some of my reasearch and thinking in the former areas - a sandbox of sorts. If you find it meaninful feel free to reach out.
