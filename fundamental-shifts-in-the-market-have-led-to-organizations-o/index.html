<p>Furthermore, machine intelligence and information has led to the rapidly diminishing value of expertise, in addition to eroding the value of information. The level of expertise needed to out-run or beat machine intelligence has exponentially increased every year. Over the next one to two years the most successful companies will come to accept the burden of proof has switched from technologies and A.I. to human expertise. Furthermore, machines will come to reframe what business and strategy means. Business expertise in the future will be the ability to synthesize and explore data sets and create options using augmented intelligence - not being an expert on a subject per se. The game changers will be those that have the fastest “information to action” at scale.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/06907229-f454-43bb-9cef-10446329445c.png" alt="" title=""><p>A residual of that characteristic makes a “good” or “ok” decision’s value exponentially highest in the beginning – and often times much more valuable than a perfect decision. To address this trend, organizations will need to focus on developing process and internal communication that foster faster “information-to-action” opportunity cost transaction times, similar to how traders look at financial markets. Those margins of competitive edge will continue to shrink, but will become exponentially more valuable.</p><p><b><i>How are businesses harnessing AI and other technologies to lead the way?</i></b></p><p>Studies show experts consistently fail at forecasting and traditionally perform worse than random guessing in businesses as diverse as medicine, real-estate valuation and political elections. This is because traditionally people weight experiences and information in very biased ways. In the knowledge economy this is detrimental to strategy and business decisions.</p><p>Working<i>with</i>machines enables businesses to learn and quantify connections and influence in a way humans cannot. Rarely is an issue isolated to the confines of a specific domain, and part of Walmart’s analytics strategy is to focus on key variables in the context of other variables that are connected. This can be done in extremely high resolution by taking a machine based approach to mine disparate data sets, which ultimately allows for flexibility and higher resolution KPIs to make business decisions with.</p><p><b><i>What are the effects of digital disintermediation and the sharing economy on productivity growth</i></b><b><i>?</i></b></p><p>Machine has increased humans ability to synthesize multiple information streams simultaneously, while connecting communication, this could lead to a higher utility on assets. It’s likely that businesses in the future will have to be more focused on opportunity cost and re-imagine asset allocation with increased competition due to lower barriers on entry. Inherently intelligence and insights is about decisions. A residual of that characteristic makes a good or ok decision’s value exponentially highest in the beginning – and often times more valuable than a perfect decision. To address this trend, organizations need to focus on developing process and internal communication that foster faster “information-to-action” transaction times, much like how traders look at financial markets.</p><p><b><i>Is this the beginning of the end?</i></b></p><p>Frameworks driven by machines will allow humans to focus on more meaningful and creative strategies by cutting through noise and finding what variables that can actually be controlled, mitigating superficial processes and problems that require computation and routine. As a result it is the end for people and companies that rely on information and routine for work. And the beginning for those that can solve abstract problems with creative and unorthodox thinking within tight margins. Those that do so will also be able to scale those skills globally with advancements in communication technology and the sharing economy, which will speed up liquidity on hard and knowledge based assets considerably.</p><picture>
